//! Search tool — full-text and/or vector similarity search across resources.
//!
//! Execution crosses the DEPLOYED API over the wire (beat G3b, the network door — the
//! second family to cross after resources): the handler drives a per-request
//! temper-client HTTP relay built from the request's `Parts` and never touches the
//! pool or a service function directly. The tool input IS `SearchParams`, the same
//! wire type `/api/search` deserializes, so nothing is restated or re-shaped here —
//! the one content block below is the only MCP-local shaping.

/// every error as `internal_error`; this one face's rendered kind changed with the

/// sweep, 2026-09-26] the sentence now renders bare — `api_error_cause` strips the
/// API Display's `Bad request: ` status label the relayed body carries, and the
/// arm's own `search: ` context prefix drops with it (a label stacked on a label) —
/// the face the G3c families already speak, adopted as the family's second declared
/// parity delta. Kind and gate identical. Everything else stays opaque, matching the
