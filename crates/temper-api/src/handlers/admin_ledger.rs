//! The admin ledger's read surface, documented under the `Admin Ledger` tag. Not in the admin
//! route group (`routes/admin.rs`) despite its path: the gate below admits the actor axis and
//! per-family readers, not only admins.
//!
//! **Authorization lives in the service, not here.** `admin_ledger_service` gates both axes
//! itself, and it does so by *dispatching per act family* rather than with a single prelude:
//! `readable_event_types` computes what this caller may read about this subject and turns that
//! into the query's `t.name = ANY($1)` bind. A gate here could not do that — no event type is
//! known until rows come back. See the service's own note.
//!
//! Deny is **404, never 403** (`list_by_subject:100-104`): a 403 would confirm the ledger has
//! something to hide about this subject, which is itself the disclosure. The contract states the
//! 404, because the 404 protects the subject, not the door.
