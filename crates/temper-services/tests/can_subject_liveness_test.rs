#![cfg(feature = "test-db")]

//! `can()`'s profile arm has two branches that must answer a subject's liveness identically: the
//! derived floor delegates to the concrete predicates, every one of which semi-joins
//! `kb_resources.is_active` / `kb_contexts.is_active`, while `profile_explicit_grant` is
//! subject-polymorphic and reads only `kb_access_grants`. The floor therefore lives in `can()`
//! itself, on the explicit branch — the same delegation shape `context_authorable_by_profile`
//! applies to its own `profile_explicit_grant` arm. Subject kinds with no liveness column
//! (`kb_cogmaps`, `kb_connections`) are deliberately unfloored: a grant row there stays
//! answerable (20260714000020), and a future grantable kind joins the floor's CASE as part of
//! its own design.
//!
//! These witnesses hold the seam to the concrete gates it unifies: `can()` and the derived gate
//! must give the same answer for a tombstoned subject, and the same answer for a live one.
