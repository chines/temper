//! Connection reach — may this caller hand read-reach on *this connection* to *that team*?
//!
//! The third two-sided gate, and the one that does **not** share
//! [`super::TwoSidedAuthority`]'s resolver. It looks similar and is not: the object side here is
//! not "do you administer this thing?" but the whole of `MachineAuthority`, and there is no
//! gating-team exclusion (a reach grant flips no regime and transfers no ownership — spec §6.1).
//! Folding it into the shared resolver would mean parameterizing away everything that is actually
//! shared.
//!
//! **Two refusal dialects, and this is not an oracle.** `ConnectionAuthority` answers `404` to a
//! caller who does not control the connection — byte-identical to a missing connection, like every
//! other per-row act through [`ConnectionControlAuthority`] — and `403` only to a caller who does
//! control it but does not manage the receiving team. That `403` reaches only callers who can
//! already `GET` the connection, so it discloses nothing a read would not. It is the argument a
//! later "let's make the denials consistent" pass has to answer before collapsing the arms, as with
//! `ContextAdminAuthority` (`super::context_admin`). "Indistinguishable" means the response, not
//! the timing: a denied id runs the authority probes a missing id never reaches.
//!
//! It also must not route through `GrantAuthority`, despite writing a `kb_access_grants` row. That
//! is stated at the call site and is load-bearing: *"the `can_grant` seam has no bootstrap holder
//! for a connection subject"* (`connection_service.rs`, `grant_reach`'s doc). A connection has no
//! principal who can grant on it, so a `can_grant` gate would deny everyone.
